# Feedback

Let me begin again by saying thank you all.

It has been a serious time to acquire and to be exposed to inexhaustible knowledge about software development. It is vast and intriguing.

I want to give a committment that this exposure and acquisition of this full-stack software development will be used to make the world better and safer. Thinking about the benefits of these programming languages, tools, frameworks, libraries, documentations, how html, css, Javascript, react js, node.js, middleware, hooks, express, mongoose,mongodb, api, endpoint, server,request header, package.json, node_module, apikey, npm, tailwind, bootstrap,Schema-based approach.....inexhaustible integrations..., there is no way one will not want to apply them.

The ablsolute truth is that this learning continues in order to understand all these concepts better and better.

Thank you Sir, Mr Tosin.
